/**

  This style won't be used automatically.

  Instead, it will become part of the app tree, so if the app uses sass, the
  'app.scss' (or some other file) can import this one

    @import 'ember-examples';

  Really, most addons should behave this way. They should not affect how your
  app looks at all.

  This addon has examples on how to include styles automatically, but this
  should only be happening if the styles are self-contained and do not affect
  the rest of the app in any way. Even then, it's probably preferable to have
  the user import the styles themselves, if they decide to do so.
